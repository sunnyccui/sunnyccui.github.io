I am a PhD student in computer science at Princeton University currently rotating with [Barbara Engelhardt](https://beehive.cs.princeton.edu/) and [Sebastian Seung](https://seunglab.org/). My research lies in the domains of deep learning and computational biology. Ultimately, I am interested in if/how models can learn intrinsic concepts to achieve human-level understanding. Currently, I want to build more interpretable and robust neural nets with neuroscience as an inspiration. 

I graduated from Caltech in 2020 with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Data Science. My undergrad research in the [Van Valen Lab](http://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/) involved optimizing deep neural networks for single cell segmentations. I have also spent two summers interning at Snap Inc. Before my exposure to computer science, I was an undergraduate research fellow at [GALCIT](https://galcit.caltech.edu/) in the [Gharib Lab](https://www.gharib.caltech.edu/), where I synthesized and characterized carbon nanotube-based strain gauge sensors for applications in human health monitoring and soft robotics.

Although I spend 80% of my waking hours staring at a screen, I try to spend the other 20% outdoors - I love running, hiking, swimming and snowboarding! Fun fact: I played D3 waterpolo in college :)
