I am a PhD student in computer science at Princeton University advised by [Barbara Engelhardt](https://beehive.cs.princeton.edu/). I am interested in using machine learning and deep learning methods to understand human biology.

I graduated from Caltech in 2020 with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Data Science. My undergrad research in the [Van Valen Lab](http://www.vanvalen.caltech.edu/) involved optimizing deep neural networks for single cell segmentations. I have also spent two summers interning at Snap Inc. Before my exposure to computer science, I was an undergraduate research fellow at [GALCIT](https://galcit.caltech.edu/) in the [Gharib Lab](https://www.gharib.caltech.edu/), where I synthesized and characterized carbon nanotube-based strain gauge sensors for applications in human health monitoring and soft robotics.

Although I spend 80% of my waking hours staring at a screen, I try to spend the other 20% outdoors - I love running, hiking, swimming and snowboarding! Fun fact: I played D3 waterpolo in college :)
